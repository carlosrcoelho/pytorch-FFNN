# pytorch-FFNN
A feed-forward neural network (FFNN) is a type of artificial neural network where information moves in one direction: forward, from the input nodes, through the hidden layers (if present), to the output nodes. It's called "feed-forward" because the data flows from input to output without any feedback loops.

## In summary, my task involves:
- Use the DataLoader to load our dataset and apply a transform to the dataset
- Implement a feed-forward neural net with input layer, hidden layer, and output layer
- Apply activation functions.
- Set up loss and optimizer
- Training loop that can use batch training.
- Evaluate our model and calculate the accuracy.
