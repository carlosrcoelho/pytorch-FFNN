# pytorch-FFNN
A feed-forward neural network (FFNN) is a type of artificial neural network where information moves in one direction: forward, from the input nodes, through the hidden layers (if present), to the output nodes. It's called "feed-forward" because the data flows from input to output without any feedback loops.
